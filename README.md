# Analysis-of-NACA-0024-Airfoil-Wing-Calibration

This repository contains the research paper "Analysis of NACA 0024 Airfoil Wing Calibration", which was completed as part of an undergraduate physics project. The paper explores the relationship between an experimental wing design based on the NACA 0024 airfoil and evaluates its stability using lift-to-drag ratio analysis. The experimental setup involved wind tunnel testing with a 3D-printed airfoil model, and the findings were compared against existing datasets to analyze flight performance and stability.
